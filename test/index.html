                <p>00_For two weeks in February, 2021, brutal winter storms
                  caused Texans to be left without power for days on end.</p>

              <div class="step" data-step="1">
                <p>01_During the crisis, all power-generation sources were
                  negatively impacted by the cold weather with the most
                  significant gap from coal and gas facilities.</p>

                <p>02_To understand what caused the Electric Reliability
                  Council of Texas to issue a level three emergency energy
                  alert, let's dig into the gas supply and demand on one
                  day: February 15.</p>

                <p>04_Using February 7 as a baseline, the normal gas supply is coming from Production (49%), Imports (13%), Storage withdrawals (38%).</p>

              <div class="step left" data-step="5">
                <p>05_On February 15, because of Production freeze-off (-20%), Import bottlenecks (-9%), Storage freeze-offs (-27%), the gas supply fell by approximately 56 percent.</p>

              <div class="step left" data-step="6">
                <p>06_Then, let’s focus on gas demand in Texas on February 15.</p>

              <div class="step left" data-step="7">
                <p>07_Nonessential liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports were cut first, with feed gas dropping by approximately 75 percent form Feb 7 to Feb 15, followed by net exports to other states.</p>

              <div class="step left" data-step="8">
                <p>08_Mexico exports were cut by one-third, even before the governor of Texas ordered cuts to exports.

              <div class="step left" data-step="9">
                <p>09_Industrial activity dropped by about 40 percent, while residential and commercial customers, typically triaged first for gas service, were nonetheless cut by about 50 percent.

              <div class="step left" data-step="10">
                <p>10_Facing both freeze-offs and a decline in fuel supply, gas power generation dropped about 40 percent.

              <div class="step left" data-step="11">
                <p>11_Finally, the total gas demand on February 15 is 16 bcfd. Even if all power generation facilities had been weatherized, Texas supply was likely 6 bcfd short of demand needs.</p>
